# HQL or JPQL?
In the Tumorotek project, we use JPQL rather than HQL. But what exactly is the difference between them, and how can we distinguish between the two?

It's essential to understand the difference between HQL (Hibernate Query Language) and JPQL (Java Persistence Query Language). Hibernate and JPA (Java Persistence API) are two different frameworks used for Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) in Java applications. Hibernate is an implementation of the JPA specification and provides additional features beyond the JPA standard.
HQL is very similar to JPQL, which is the standard query language defined by the JPA specification. Both HQL and JPQL use entity class names and their mapped properties instead of SQL table and column names.
When using Hibernate as your JPA implementation, you can write queries in HQL, which is very similar to JPQL. However, for greater portability across various JPA implementations, it's recommended to stick to using JPQL.
In most cases, it can be challenging to distinguish between HQL and JPQL in an existing project just by looking at the query strings, as they are quite similar. However, you can examine certain factors to determine whether JPQL or HQL is being used.

- **Import Statements:** In HQL, you might see import statements specific to Hibernate classes, such as `import org.hibernate.Query`, while JPQL won't have these Hibernate-specific imports.
- **JPA Annotations:** If the project uses JPA annotations like `@Entity`, `@Table`, `@Column`, etc., it's more likely that JPQL is being used. While Hibernate supports these annotations as well, they are part of the JPA specification.
- **Hibernate-specific Features:** If you encounter Hibernate-specific features or annotations in the code, like `@Type` or `@Filter`, it's a strong indicator of HQL usage.
- **JPA Query API:** If you see code creating TypedQuery or Query objects using JPA's EntityManager (`entityManager.createQuery()`), it's more likely to be JPQ

Please note that these are general indicators and not definitive proof of whether H

## Using JPQ
To use JPQ in your project:

1. Define thJPQl Q: Construct thJPQl query as a string using thJPQl syntax. You'll use Java class names and their mapped properties instead of SQL table and column names.
2.Logging (Optional): Before executing thqueryou might want tlogthe generatedJPQl query fo debugging purposes.
3.CreateanEntityManager: Declareth entityManagerFactoryand createanEntityManagerinstance
4.CreateaTypedQuery: CreateaTypedQuery object usingthcreateQuery() method ontheEntityManagerpassingthJPQl queryasan argument
5.SetParameters: IftheJPQl query includes parameterssetthemusingthe appropriate methods (setParameter()or setXxx())ontheTypedQuery object
6.Execute thQuerynd Retrieve Results: Execute thqueryusingthe getResultList() methodto fetch alistofentities that matchthquerycriteria
