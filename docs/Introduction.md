# Introduction

Welcome to the Tumorotek Project Documentation Hub. This resource has been thoughtfully structured to support both developers, managers and non-developers in understanding and contributing to the Tumorotek project more effectively. I’ve organized the content into six main sections to cover essential aspects of development, best practices, and security, each aimed at helping you navigate the project with ease.

1. **Best Practices**: To foster efficient collaboration and maintain code quality, this section outlines development methodologies, GitHub workflows, and guidelines for teamwork. These practices are here to serve as a foundation, helping everyone work toward a unified and high-quality project.


2. **Errors**: A collection of encountered errors and their solutions. This knowledge base helps developers:
   - Save time by learning from past troubleshooting experiences
   - Avoid common pitfalls in development and deployment
   - Quickly resolve similar issues when they arise
   - Understand root causes and implement preventive measures
   - Share solutions across the team to prevent duplicate problem-solving efforts

3. **Java & Spring**: For backend development, this section provides guidance on Java and Spring implementation, entity management, data access techniques etc... 

4. **Libraries**: To simplify working with external libraries, this section offers guidance on using integrations such as Apache POI, Liquibase etc... The goal is to make these integrations as straightforward as possible also for developers who are not familiar with them.

5. **Security**: Security is crucial, and this section covers audit findings providing recommendations to strengthen project safety and teach the reader about security dangers and how to avoid them.

2. **Tumorotek**: This section offering an overview of the Tumorotek project, guidance on setting up your environment, naming conventions and everything that realated specically to Tumorotek. 

4. **ZK Framework**: In this section, you’ll find resources on using the ZK framework for the front end, covering topics like architectural patterns (MVC vs. MVVM), component lifecycle, and UI interaction etc...


I hope this documentation serves as a useful, evolving guide to support your work on the Tumorotek project. Each section is here to help simplify processes, foster best practices, and make collaboration easier for everyone.


## About Me
I am a Full Stack Developer with expertise in Python, Java, TypeScript, and JavaScript. With my dedication to clean, maintainable code and passion for simplicity in design, I integrate DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) and KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) principles into every project. This approach not only reduces development time but also enhances collaboration and efficiency, saving both time and resources.

Throughout my experience with SESAN and Nat System, I have built robust applications, provided effective debugging solutions, and contributed to project documentation, ensuring code is accessible and scalable. I value continuous learning and stay updated on emerging technologies, eager to share insights and grow alongside peers in the industry.


The purpose of this technical document base is twofold:
1. To serve as a comprehensive knowledge base for the Tumorotek project, providing developers and non-developers with best practices, guidelines, and technical documentation
2. To act as the primary reference for troubleshooting and problem-solving during development and maintenance


## How to Use This Documentation

Each chapter is organized to provide both theoretical knowledge and practical implementation guidance. Readers should:
1. Start with the General section to understand project fundamentals
2. Reference specific chapters based on development needs
3. Follow best practices and security guidelines throughout development
4. Use the How-To guides for step-by-step implementation assistance
